# Tartan OS

A toy OS written in Rust. The name is a reference to the old logo of a certain rust
removal product.

So far, it is not much more than a UEFI bootloader with some in-progress support for ACPI
(including an AML parser and interpreter).

This is mainly a personal learning project to get familiar with Rust, as well as to update
my knowledge about OS internals and hardware that's newer than the PC/AT. ðŸ™ƒ


## Dependencies

Tested on macOS only.

* Rust 1.47.0 _nightly_ toolchain, for better cross-compilation features in Cargo
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) 5.0
* bash 3.0+ for the launcher script

Suggested additional tools:
  * [`cargo-binutils`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils)


## Build

```
cargo build
```

Emits an AMD64 UEFI bootloader application (a PE image) at
`target/x86_64-unknown-uefi/debug/tartan-os.efi`.


## Run

```
cargo run
```

Packages the bootloader into a GPT + FAT disk image and launches it in QEMU.


## Test

```
cargo test-host

# Or explicitly, if you need to adjust the host target:
cargo test -Z build-std=core,alloc,std --target x86_64-apple-darwin
```

Runs tests on your local machine.  There is currently no support for running the tests on
the target architecture in QEMU. Since the default build target is AMD64 UEFI
(`x86_64-unknown-uefi`), `cargo test` doesn't work without additional flags.


## Documentation

```
cargo doc --open
```


## Lint

```
cargo clippy
```

I would be willing to release this under a more permissive license if someone finds it
useful, but I don't expect that to be the case.
