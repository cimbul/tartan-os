# Tartan OS

A toy OS written in Rust. The name is a reference to the old logo of a certain rust
removal product.

So far, it is not much more than a UEFI bootloader with some in-progress support for ACPI
(including an AML parser and interpreter).

This is mainly a personal learning project to get familiar with Rust, as well as to update
my knowledge about OS internals and hardware that's newer than the PC/AT. ðŸ™ƒ


## Dependencies

Tested on macOS only.

* Rust 1.47.0 _nightly_ toolchain, for better cross-compilation features in Cargo
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) 5.0
* bash 3.0+ for the launcher script

In order to edit the ACPI parser integration tests, you will also need tools documented
at [acpi/tests/parse/README.md](acpi/tests/parse/README.md).

Suggested additional tools:
  * [`cargo-binutils`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils)


## Build

Note that when building, running, or testing with Cargo, the default target will *depend
on your current directory*:
  * From the main directory, Cargo will build for your host system by default.
	* From the `uefi/` directory, Cargo will build for the `x86_64-unknown-uefi` target,
	  along with flags to compile the standard Rust libraries. This is configured in
		`uefi/.cargo/config.toml`.

To build the libraries for your host system:

```
cargo build
```

To build the AMD64 UEFI bootloader:

```
(cd uefi && cargo build)
```

The UEFI application (a PE image) will be emitted at
`target/x86_64-unknown-uefi/debug/tartan-uefi.efi`.


## Run UEFI bootloader

```
(cd uefi && cargo run)
```

Packages the bootloader into a GPT + FAT disk image and launches it in QEMU.


## Test

```
cargo test
```

Runs tests on your host system. There is currently no support for running the tests on the
target architecture in QEMU.


## Documentation

```
cargo doc --open
```


## Lint

```
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

I would be willing to release this under a more permissive license if someone finds it
useful, but I don't expect that to be the case.
